# MMATH-24-25-schroedinger-operator-on-the-real-line
The MATLAB scripts in this file compute finite difference approximations for the lower end of the spectra of Schrodinger operators on an interval. This is then used to demonstrate domain truncation as a method of approximating the discrete spectra in spectral gaps of perturbed periodic potentials on the real line.
